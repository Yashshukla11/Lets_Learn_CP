# PROBLEM STATEMENT

In a grid, a cell is said to be good if the value in the cell is maximum in its column and minimum in its row. You are given two integers N and X.

Determine whether there exists any N×N grid with exactly X good cells. The grid can contain repeated elements. You have to answer T such queries.

### INPUT FORMATE

First line will contain 
�
T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
The only line of each test case contains a two space separated integers N (1≤N≤5000) and X (1≤X≤N^2).

### OUTPUT FORMATE

For every test case if a grid with required conditions exists then print "Yes" otherwise print "No"(without quotes).


### CONSTRAINTS

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000<br>
1 ≤ N ≤ 5000<br>
1 ≤ X ≤ N^2<br>
