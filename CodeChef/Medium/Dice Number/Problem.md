## Problem Statement

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Each player rolls a regular six-faced dice 3 times. The score of a player is the maximum number that can be formed using the rolls. The player with the highest score wins, and the game ends in a tie if both players have the same score.

Find the winner of the game or determine whether it is a tie.

## Input Format

The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains six space-separated integers A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, and B3 — the values Alice gets in her 3 dice rolls, followed by the values which Bob gets in his 3 dice rolls.

## Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line Alice if Alice wins, Bob if Bob wins, and Tie in case of a tie.

Note that you may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings "tie," "TIE," "Tie," and "tIe" are considered identical.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4
- 1 ≤ A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3 ≤ 6

## Sample
```
Input:
3
3 2 5 6 1 1
4 4 5 5 4 4
6 6 6 6 6 1

Test Case 3: Alice's score is 666, which is greater than Bob's score 661.
